1. 
(a)We have to specify which color and ball variables we want to using in Ball class.
If we want to use color and ball from inside Ball class, we have to specify as
this.color/ball. If we want to use pass in variables, we don't need to clarify it.
we have to make such clarification because pass in variable has the same name
as private class variable.
(b)Instead of returning 0 in getVolume(), we should return this.volume

2. 
I think if we just add a variable to record total volume as we add/remove balls
from the container will be better. In this case, our call to getVolume() or when we
add/remove balls only takes O(1) runtime to make access total volume, other method, 
we would have to go through the entire list of balls every time we call getVolume() 
function.

3.
(a) In Box class, we could create a custom sorted arrayList to store all balls in the
order of increasing volume size. Whenever we add a ball to the last of the list, we 
reorder all balls in the correct order, then return the iterator of the first ball in 
the box.
(b) TreeSet would give a sortedï¼Œ ascending ordered set. If we use TreeSet to store all 
the balls, all balls would be sorted by keys, and then we just need to return the iterator
of the first ball in the TreeSet.

I think method 2 is much better since we don't need to sort the list every time we add
a ball to the container, it would be a lot efficient.
